CovertTweeter
=============

Stealth Twitter client.

Setup
-----

As with most Twitter API clients you will need to configure the API keys and access tokens.

By default the values are pulled from the registry. Easiest way to set it up is edit the setup.reg file under `%reporoot%/Resources` and put in the relevant values. If you don't have any, you will need to create your own at dev.twitter.com
